Plants :
- Changed some convar related things.
- Small plants spawn small melons, Big plants spawn big melon.
- Melon are spawn at higher places to prevent them geting stuck in the map ( you should not let tree grows in corner, they need a lot of space ! )

NPCS :
- Changed a lot of convar value to balance things
- Added a young state, npcs grow fast then stop ( young ) then grow again.
- NPCS are not eating their own meat, they won't target it, but they still become crazy if not enough food is present ( and very hungry , this does not affect human )
- NPCS can now eat eggs to stay alive
- Zombie drops 1 human and 1 headcrabs meat on death. (non natural death)
-Human now have crowbar !

Note : 
Zombie are considered as headcrab, they can eat human meat but not headcrab one.
